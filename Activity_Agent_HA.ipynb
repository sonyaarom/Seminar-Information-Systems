    "A drawback to our approach is that we are not able to apply conventional model evaluation techniques to our model. We will train our model for each day to account for newly available information. Hence, we have different train and test sets for each day and for each day different performance metric based on the respective data sets. Therefore, we created our own evaluation function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our evaluation function will build a model, fit the model and predict the target for each day for a given prediction period. For each day and fitted model it will calculate a performance metric on the train data. We chose the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) as performance metric for our binary classification task. As in our case the test data is only the current date to be predicted (i.e. 24 data cases in the test data, one for each hour of the day), calculating the AUC on the test date immediately would lead to a high volatility in the test AUC per day to be predicted. Therefore, we calculate the test AUC over the activity probabilities of all days after all days have been predicted. To summarize the train AUC in one score, we apply an average over all calculated train AUC scores."
